# rilb - Real Backend Starter

**rilb** (Real Backend Starter) is a kick-off template for building Node.js applications with Express. It's designed to provide a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable backend applications using TypeScript. This starter includes various tools and libraries for efficient development, including Inversify for dependency injection, Inversify Express Utils for Express framework utilities, TypeORM for backend ORM with MySQL support, JWT for authentication, Bcryptjs for security, and a custom error handling system based on exceptions and responses.

## Features

- **Express with TypeScript**: rilb is built using TypeScript and Express.js, making it a robust and type-safe foundation for your backend applications.

- **Dependency Injection**: It utilizes Inversify for dependency injection, making your code more modular and testable.

- **ORM Support**: TypeORM is integrated to simplify database interactions, with MySQL as the default database.

- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are included for secure authentication.

- **Security**: Bcryptjs is used for hashing passwords to enhance the security of your application.

- **Custom Error Handling**: rilb comes with a custom error handling system based on exceptions and standardized responses, simplifying the handling of errors.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with rilb:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rilb.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure your database connection in `ormconfig.json`.
4. Run the application: `npm start`

## Project Structure

The project structure is designed to be scalable and maintainable:

- `src/controllers`: Contains your Express route controllers.
- `src/middleware`: Middleware functions can be placed here.
- `src/models`: Define your data models using TypeORM entities.
- `src/repositories`: Repository classes for database interactions.
- `src/services`: Business logic and services.
- `src/utils`: Utility functions and classes.
- `src/errors`: Custom error classes.
- `src/config`: Configuration files.
- `src/index.ts`: Application entry point.

## Configuration

- Configure your database connection in `ormconfig.json`.

## Running the Application

- Start the application: `npm start`
- By default, the application runs on port 3000. You can change this in the configuration.

## Testing

- You can write tests using testing libraries of your choice (e.g., Jest) in the `tests` directory.
